## Development

Primary code contributor:

 - Zachary Levonian (<zach@digitalharbor.org>)

## Local development setup

This project uses `make` and `Poetry` to manage and install dependencies.

On Windows, you'll need to use WSL and maybe make some other changes.

### Python development

Use `make install` to install all needed dependencies (including the pre-commit hooks and Poetry).

You'll probably need to manually add Poetry to your PATH, e.g. by updating your `.bashrc` (or relevant equivalent):

```bash
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
```

### Run tests

```bash
make test
```

### Run Jupyter Lab

```bash
make jupyter
```

Which really just runs `poetry run jupyter lab`, so feel free to customize your Jupyter experience.

### Other useful commands

 - `poetry run <command>` - Run the given command, e.g. `poetry run pytest` invokes the tests.
 - `poetry add <package>` - Add the given package as a dependency. Use flag `-G dev` to add it as a development dependency.
